"""Windows MSIX (packaged-app) launch-on-login backend.

Packaged apps can't use the per-user Run key — Windows ignores Run-key
entries from packages. Autostart for a packaged app is a *startup task*
declared in the manifest (``windows.startupTask`` with
``TaskId="<app>Startup"``) and toggled at runtime through the
``Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask`` WinRT API. The user can always
override us from Settings -> Apps -> Startup; once they disable it there,
Windows forbids programmatic re-enable (state ``DisabledByUser``).

Mirrors the public backend API (``is_supported``/``is_enabled``/``enable``/
``disable``). Every call is defensively wrapped: a WinRT/projection failure
degrades to "unsupported" instead of raising, so a packaging quirk can never
crash startup.

Threading — why every call hops to a worker thread:
``StartupTask``'s API is asynchronous, and the only synchronous way to consume
an ``IAsyncOperation`` is its blocking ``.get()`` — which WinRT forbids on a
single-threaded apartment. The Qt GUI thread is an STA (Qt and ``comtypes``
initialise it that way), so calling ``.get()`` there raises ``RuntimeError:
Cannot call blocking method from single-threaded apartment`` (observed
in-package 2026-06-18). Each WinRT touch therefore runs on a short-lived thread
initialised ``MULTI_THREADED`` (an MTA), where the blocking wait is legal; only
a plain ``bool`` crosses back to the GUI thread. (Synchronous WinRT calls are
fine on the STA; only the blocking await is not.) ``_TASK_ID`` must match
``AppxManifest.xml`` exactly.
