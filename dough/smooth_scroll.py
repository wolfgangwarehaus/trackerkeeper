"""App-wide smooth scrolling for mouse-wheel input.

Mouse wheels arrive as discrete notches (120 angleDelta units per
click on a standard wheel). Without animation, each notch jumps the
content by a chunk of pixels — janky on long lists and especially
bad on horizontal album rails where the per-notch jump is huge
relative to a tile.

This filter installs at the QApplication level and intercepts every
QWheelEvent. For each event it:

  1. Walks up the receiver's parent chain to find the closest
     QAbstractScrollArea that has scroll *range* on the wheel's
     dominant axis. This naturally bubbles past inner scroll areas
     that can't move on the requested axis (e.g. the Suggestions
     rails, which have no vertical range, so a vertical wheel rolls
     straight up to the page's outer scroll).
  2. Animates that scrollbar's value toward the new target via
     QPropertyAnimation. Successive wheel notches coalesce into one
     moving target so spinning the wheel quickly produces a single
     smooth glide rather than a stack of conflicting tweens.

Trackpad input (non-zero pixelDelta) bypasses animation — the OS
already delivers smooth motion at the native input rate, so adding
an animation layer would lag behind the gesture.
