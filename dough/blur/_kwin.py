"""KWindowSystem blur backend — `KWindowEffects::enableBlurBehind()`
reached through ctypes against ``libKF6WindowSystem``.

Why ctypes: KF6 ships no Python binding, and `QtWaylandClient` (which
would let us marshal the blur protocol ourselves) isn't bundled with
PySide6. ``enableBlurBehind`` is a plain — if mangled — C++ symbol, so
ctypes is the clean route. KWindowSystem itself does the hard parts:
it speaks `ext-background-effect-v1` where the compositor advertises it
and falls back to the legacy `org_kde_kwin_blur`, translates an empty
QRegion to "blur the whole window", and re-applies blur via its own
event filter whenever the Wayland surface is recreated — so callers
just call once per show / theme change.

Everything is best-effort: a missing library or symbol, a window with
no platform surface yet, a compositor with no blur protocol — all
resolve to a silent no-op. Blur is pure progressive enhancement.

    KWindowSystem talks to Wayland through Qt's native interface, and that

    cannot obtain it from another. When the check fails, Qt hands back
    nullptr, and ``enableBlurBehind`` returns normally WITHOUT ever sending
    ``org_kde_kwin_blur.create`` — the request is dropped on the floor and

    shipped PySide6's bundled Qt over the runtime's, so KF6 — built against
    the runtime's Qt — was handed a Qt it couldn't speak to.

    The failure is silent by design (blur is fire-and-forget; KWin sends no
    ack), and Qt reports it ONLY by logging. So we run the call once, for
    real, on a throwaway QWindow — created but never shown, so there is no
    visible artifact — with a message handler installed, and watch for the
    complaint.
