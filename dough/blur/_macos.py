"""macOS blur backend — NSVisualEffectView vibrancy (the frosted backdrop).

Behind a translucent Qt window we install an ``NSVisualEffectView`` (blending
mode "behind window") as a SIBLING of Qt's content view, ordered strictly
*below* it. Qt already paints Frosted-mode chrome with
``WA_TranslucentBackground``, so the system vibrancy shows through the
transparent body — the macOS-native equivalent of KWin's blur-behind on Linux.
``probe()`` therefore reports ``ACTIVE`` (a real, verified backdrop) so frosted
surfaces ride it at full glass alpha instead of the near-opaque fallback.

Why sibling-below and not a content-view swap: the earlier implementation made
the effect view the window's *content view* and re-parented Qt's view on top of
it. That demotes ``QNSView`` from the content-view slot, and macOS then stops
auto-sizing it (blank margins on resize) while ``QCocoaWindow`` keeps re-asserting
``QNSView`` as the content view on recreate/state changes (QTBUG-69302) — ripping
the effect view back out and blanking the window on activation. Keeping QNSView as
the content view and inserting the effect view into its superview (the private
theme frame) via ``addSubview:positioned:NSWindowBelow relativeTo:`` sidesteps
both: Qt never loses content-view ownership, so resize, hit-testing, cursors and
recreate all keep working. This is Electron's vibrancy pattern, hoisted one level
because in Qt the QNSView itself is the content view.

Reversible: ``apply(widget, False)`` drops the effect view and restores the
window's original opacity/background. ``corner_radius`` rounds the effect layer to
match a frameless rounded window so the frost doesn't square off the corners.
``elevated`` popups get the lighter ``.popover`` material.

NOTE: the structural path (insert / refresh / remove, no crash) is exercised
headlessly, but the VISUAL result and window-resize/activation behaviour must be
judged on a real display — a remote framebuffer (VNC) misrepresents vibrancy.
