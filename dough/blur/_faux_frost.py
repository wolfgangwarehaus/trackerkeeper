"""Faux frosted-glass backdrop — the no-real-blur fallback.

When a frosted theme can't get genuine compositor blur, a translucent
surface would otherwise be a flat near-opaque panel (``fallback_body_alpha``).
The cases where no compositor blur is available:

  * GNOME / Wayland — no "blur-behind" Wayland protocol exists, and Mutter
    doesn't implement KDE's private one.
  * Windows without Mica (Windows 10, or transparency disabled).
  * KDE with the Blur desktop effect switched off.
  * macOS with Reduce Transparency turned on (no vibrancy).

Instead of a flat rectangle we paint a *self-contained frosted texture* that
reads as real frosted glass rather than dead paint: a few soft lighter blooms
over the theme's body colour, melted together by a smooth upscale (cheap blur)
and finished with a faint film grain so it looks diffused. Neutral (no hue
tint) and fully deterministic — it needs zero compositor support and stays
stable across repaints. Cached per (size, base colour); rebuilt only on resize
or theme change, so any surface that shares a body colour falls back
identically. The base colour comes from :func:`dough.theme.body_color_for`;
whether a real backdrop was verified behind the window is reported by
:func:`dough.blur.status`.
