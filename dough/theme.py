dough theme registry.

A `Theme` is a frozen palette: the full set of semantic color tokens a
widget needs to style itself, plus the RGBA tuples used by paintEvent
body fills (which can't go through QSS because Qt stylesheets don't
reliably honor alpha on translucent QFrame children — see the long
note in `mini_player.py`).

The token set is named by *intent* (`wash_hover`, `surface_input`,
`idle_text`, …), not by the value it happens to hold. This is the
layer that swaps wholesale between a dark and a light theme — see
`docs/research/theming.md`. Every painted surface references these
tokens; the dark family shares one set of token values
(`_DARK_TOKENS`) and the light family another (`_LIGHT_TOKENS`); the
three themes in each family differ only in surface/border depth and
body opacity.

Adding a new theme: append a new `Theme(...)` constant and register it
in `THEMES`. `ui_helpers.py` reads `get_active_theme()` once at import
and re-exports its colors as module-level constants for back-compat.

Live theme switching IS wired: ``ui_helpers.refresh_theme()`` re-reads every
token in place and a ``AppBus.theme_changed`` emit re-stamps the whole app,
so a theme-mode change — and the OS-driven ``"auto"`` (follow-OS) swap — applies
with no restart. Only ``font_scale`` still needs a relaunch.

    # Frosted-only: the body alpha to fall back to when a real compositor
    # backdrop is NOT verified behind the window (blur disabled, no blur
    # protocol, non-KDE desktop, Windows < 11). The frosted body_color
    # above carries the *glass* alpha (~67%) that relies on blur for

    # reads as a dark/light frosted panel. None on non-frosted themes —

# ── Shared dark-family tokens ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The three dark themes differ only in surface/border depth and body
# opacity; every other token is identical. They all splat this dict so

# its own — the constructor requires every field, so a half-authored
# light theme fails loudly instead of silently inheriting dark values.
# ── Elevated-surface shared knob (dark modes) ──────────────────────
# ONE source of truth for every "elevated" surface in dark themes —
# button hovers, list-row highlights, hover tooltips, dropdown popups,
# the volume slider panel. They all read this constant, so tweaking
# the alpha here moves all of them in unison.
#
# Sits on top of the (already-blurred-in-frosted) body as a soft LIGHT
# wash that LIFTS the surface a notch — the same look the Settings
# left-nav uses for the selected row (``ink_alpha(0.10)``). Reads as
# "panel lifted off the body" rather than "panel pressed into a hole",
# which is the visual the user picked as the project-wide hover/
# selection tone. Top-level popups (combo popups, QMenus, QToolTip)
# bake the body+wash COMPOSITE to opaque (``_DARK_ELEVATED_TOPLEVEL``)
# because Wayland compositor blur is fragile on those surfaces.
_DARK_ELEVATED_ALPHA = 0.10
_DARK_ELEVATED = f"rgba(255, 255, 255, {_DARK_ELEVATED_ALPHA})"
# Pressed sits a touch brighter than hover (lighter wash) so the
# pressed feedback still reads against a hovered button — same
# polarity as the light family.
_DARK_ELEVATED_PRESSED = f"rgba(255, 255, 255, {_DARK_ELEVATED_ALPHA + 0.05})"
# Frosted-theme TOP-LEVEL elevated fill — for tooltip / menu / combo
# popup surfaces that don't sit on top of the main window body. The
# value is the body+wash COMPOSITE expressed as a translucent rgba
# so the surface can ride compositor blur and read as ACTUAL frosted
# glass (matching how the volume popup, button hover, and Settings
# left-nav selected row look).
#
# The raw composite math (body 18,18,18,0.675 under _DARK_ELEVATED
# 255,255,255,0.10) yields rgba(51,51,51,0.71). But what's behind a
# top-level popup is the BLURRED MAIN WINDOW CONTENT (body + album
# art + text), which sits darker than a button-highlight surface
# composites over (just body + wallpaper). To make the tooltip read
# at the same tone as the in-window highlight, we lighten the
# painted colour a few points and drop the alpha so more wallpaper
# shows through — visually matching the highlight regardless of the
# darker content underneath the popup. Slight cool tint mirrors how
# the volume popup picks up wallpaper warmth/cool through its wash.
# NEUTRAL gray (no tint): the button hover highlight is a pure white
# wash with no hue, so every elevated popup (tooltip, menu, volume
# popup) matches it by staying neutral — an earlier cool/blue cast
# (64/67/74) read "cooler" than the button (reported 2026-06-07).
# Luminance preserved from that prior value.

# Companion to _DARK_ELEVATED — the OPAQUE flavour used by every
# TOP-LEVEL elevated surface (QToolTip, QMenu, combo popups). These
# can't reliably be translucent + compositor-blurred on Wayland:
#   - QTipLabel inherits surface translucency from the owning widget
#     tree, so a translucent QSS composites directly with the desktop
#     for top-bar tooltips (reads as floating text with no backdrop).
#   - QComboBox popup windows + QMenus have several internal autofill
#     paths (popup QFrame, view, viewport) that paint opaque before
#     the QSS, defeating WA_TranslucentBackground.
# So they all read off this single opaque constant — tuned to LOOK
# like _DARK_ELEVATED would if it were composited over the blurred
# body (which is what volume-popup-style child widgets achieve for
# free). Adjust here to retint every menu, dropdown, and tooltip in
# unison.
# Neutral (no blue cast) to match the button hover highlight — see
