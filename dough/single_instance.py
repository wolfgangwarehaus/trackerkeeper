"""
Single-instance enforcement.

Standard Qt pattern: QSharedMemory acts as the lock (its existence
proves an instance is running), QLocalServer accepts an out-of-band
"raise me" message from any subsequent launch attempts. Second launch
detects the lock, sends the message via QLocalSocket, exits cleanly.

Why both:
- QSharedMemory alone would let us detect duplicates but not signal
  the running instance to come forward.
- QLocalServer alone would work on a clean exit but races on startup
  (two simultaneous launches both try to create the server).
- Together: the shared-memory create() is atomic and acts as the
  arbiter, the local server is just the message channel.

Stale-segment recovery: if the previous instance was SIGKILL'd, the
shared-memory segment may persist on Linux. We detect this by trying
to *connect* to the local server when attach() succeeds — if no one's
listening, the holder is dead and we force-recover.
