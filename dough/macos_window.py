"""macOS native window chrome — transparent titlebar + full-size content view.

The native macOS pattern for a custom-chrome app (Safari, Xcode, and other
apps that draw their own toolbar): keep the real NSWindow — traffic lights,
native resize/zoom/fullscreen/tiling all keep working (never go frameless on
Mac) — but make the titlebar TRANSPARENT and let the content fill the whole
window (NSWindowStyleMaskFullSizeContentView). The window's frosted backdrop
then flows up to the native rounded top corners with the traffic-light cluster
floating over it; no separate dark titlebar strip, no app-drawn top corners.

The app reserves a thin top inset in its chrome layout (gated on IS_MACOS) so
the top bar clears the traffic lights while the vibrancy shows through behind
them.

pyobjc; macOS-only; called once after the window exists.
