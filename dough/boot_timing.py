"""Boot-phase wall-clock instrumentation, opt-in via ``DOUGH_BOOT_TIMING=1``.

Answers "where does startup time go on THIS machine" without a profiler:
``mark()`` calls sprinkled along the boot path log the delta since
process-ish start (this module's import, which app.py does first) and
since the previous mark. Designed for cross-machine comparison — run the
same build on Linux and Windows and diff the phase table.

Disabled (the default), each ``mark()`` is a single attribute check —
safe to leave the call sites in permanently.

Usage on any install:
    DOUGH_BOOT_TIMING=1 dough            (fish/bash)
    $env:DOUGH_BOOT_TIMING="1"; dough    (PowerShell)
