"""Window "blur behind" — the frosted-glass effect for translucent
surfaces. This is what visually separates Frosted mode (blurred glass)
from Transparent mode (clear glass).

Public API:
    is_supported() -> bool          # backend can *request* blur
    apply(widget, enabled) -> bool  # enable/disable blur behind widget
    status() -> BlurStatus          # is a real backdrop VERIFIED behind us?

The status() call is the one that fixes the "frosted renders see-through"
class of bug: `apply()` is fire-and-forget (KWin gives no success signal),
so a frosted body painted at ~67% opacity goes transparent-broken wherever
blur silently no-ops (Blur effect off, missing plugin, no compositing, a
non-KDE desktop, Windows < 11). `status()` probes whether a real backdrop
is actually present so the theme layer can pick the body alpha — full glass
when blur landed, a near-opaque "frosted panel" fallback when it didn't.
See trackerkeeper/theme.body_color_for() and docs/research/portable_blur.md.

Backend (Linux): KDE's KWindowSystem — `KWindowEffects::enableBlurBehind`
to request blur and `KWindowEffects::isEffectAvailable(BlurBehind)` to
verify it, both via ctypes (no PySide6 binding exists). KWindowSystem
speaks `ext-background-effect-v1` where the compositor offers it and falls
back to the legacy `org_kde_kwin_blur` — so this covers KWin, and also niri
/ COSMIC where KWindowSystem is installed.

Everywhere else (Windows, macOS, or a Linux box without KWindowSystem, or a
compositor with no blur protocol — Hyprland/Wayfire/sway/GNOME): the
backend reports UNSUPPORTED and the window paints a near-opaque body. On
compositors that blur via user config rather than a protocol (Hyprland,
Wayfire, SwayFX), the user can target trackerkeeper in their own window rules:
our Wayland app_id is the stable string "trackerkeeper" (set via
setDesktopFileName).
