"""No-op blur backend — the fallback when no platform backend applies.

This is the final ``else`` in :mod:`trackerkeeper.blur` dispatch: it is
selected only for platforms with no real blur backend of their own.
Windows (``_dwm``, acrylic) and macOS (``_macos``) each have their own
backend module now, so the boxes that land here are Linux machines
without KWindowSystem, or a compositor with no app-controllable blur
protocol (Hyprland / Wayfire / sway / GNOME). The window simply renders
without blur — the theme's near-opaque body is the intended no-blur
baseline.
