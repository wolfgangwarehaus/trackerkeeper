/*
    dough — full-repaint-on-drag KWin scripted effect.

    While one of this app's windows is being interactively moved, hold it under
    an in-progress transform. KWin renders any *transformed* window through
    paintGenericScreen() — a full-frame repaint — instead of the optimized
    paintSimpleScreen() partial-damage path. That partial-damage path is where
    the NVIDIA blur "stale rectangle" artifact lives (KWin bug 455526 / 457727),
    so forcing the full-repaint path for the duration of the drag avoids it.

    The transform must be an *in-progress* animate(), not a static set(): a
    completed set() lets KWin treat the window as a static transformed window
    and still optimize partial damage. An animation that is genuinely in
    progress is repainted by KWin every frame for its whole duration — the
    same continuous per-frame full repaint Wobbly Windows relies on. So we run
    a 6px Translation spread over an hour (~0.0017 px/s — an imperceptible
    drift) and cancel it the moment the drag ends.

    Caveat handled here: KWin's blur effect skips blur on *transformed*
    windows (shouldBlur(): `&& !WindowForceBlurRole`). Without compensation
    our own transform would drop the blur for the whole drag. So we set
    Effect.WindowForceBlurRole while the transform is held — the same trick
    the built-in `maximize` effect uses — and clear it when the drag ends.

    {{app_id}} is substituted from the running app's identity when the effect is
    installed (dough/drag_repaint/_kwin.py), so a fork matches its own windows
    with no source edit — see the module docstring.
