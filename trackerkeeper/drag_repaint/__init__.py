"""Drag-repaint fix — kills the stale-blur "line artifact" that KWin
leaves behind a translucent window dragged on the NVIDIA EGL path.

The artifact (KWin bug 455526 / 457727) lives in KWin's optimized
`paintSimpleScreen` partial-damage render path. A *transformed* window
is instead rendered through `paintGenericScreen` — a full-frame repaint
— which never exercises the buggy path. trackerkeeper ships a tiny KWin scripted
effect that, while one of its own windows is being dragged, holds it
under an imperceptible in-progress transform (and force-blurs it so the
blur survives the transform). Visually inert; it only flips KWin onto
the clean render path for the duration of the drag.

Public API:
    is_supported() -> bool   # backend can install the effect
    install() -> bool        # idempotent install + enable + load
    uninstall() -> bool      # idempotent unload + disable + remove
    sync() -> bool           # install (or, under TRACKERKEEPER_NO_DRAG_REPAINT,
                             #   uninstall) — the one call boot makes
    diagnose() -> dict       # backend-specific debug snapshot

KDE Wayland: the `_kwin` backend renders the bundled effect (scoped to the
running app's identity — see `_kwin`) into the user's KWin effects directory
and asks KWin to load it. Anywhere else (X11, Windows, macOS, non-KDE
Wayland): the unsupported backend no-ops — the artifact is a KWin/NVIDIA-
specific bug and the fix is too.

`TRACKERKEEPER_NO_DRAG_REPAINT=1` forces `sync()` to remove the effect instead of
installing it — a support escape hatch, not a user-facing setting.
