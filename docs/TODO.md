# dough — TODO / handoff

Status as of **2026-06-22**. dough is stand-alone-safe, tested, and library-shaped;
the jellytoast inversion is validated as feasible; the **baking phase has started**
(the metadata core landed). This is the pick-up list for next time. See
`docs/ROADMAP.md` (the P0→P3 plan) and `docs/BAKING.md` (the release-phase spec)
for the why.

## Done this round

- **P0 — stand-alone-safe gate** (merged to `main`): test foundation + pytest CI
  job; deleted the dead music functions; rewired `CoverOverlayButton`/`EmptyState`
  onto `AppBus`; recast `power/` to explicit `inhibit()/release()`; the identity
  seam (`dough/identity.py` + `dough.configure()`), fixing the import-time
  `QSettings` coupling.
- **`docs/BAKING.md`** — the baking-phase spec (one metadata source → every
  manifest → verify; the channel matrix; dynamic versioning; templated `packaging/`).
- **P1 beat 1** — `run_app()` entry, curated lazy public API, `AppBus.set_factory()`.
- **P1 beat 2** — `AppWindow` extension seams (`_make_top_bar`, `set_footer`,
  `_paint_body_backdrop`) + per-test Qt-window isolation (killed a teardown segfault).
- **Inversion go/no-go** — validated GO: bus half proven live (a now-removed
  jellytoast worktree spike), window half proven by `test_jellytoast_shaped_window`.
- **Baking phase — Beat 1 (the metadata core)**: the `[tool.dough.metadata]`
  sidecar (one source: ~9 inputs + the descriptive/store union, schema-versioned);
  the projection engine on `dough/identity.py` (pure `aumid_for`/`app_id_base_for`/
  `cf_bundle_id_for` helpers + runtime `app_id_base`/`cf_bundle_id`/`desktop_id`/
  `owner`); `dough/metadata.py` (build-time sidecar reader — `load`/`projections`/
  `context`); **dynamic versioning** via `setuptools-scm` (the tag is the version;
  generated `dough/_version.py` + a source-checkout fallback in `__init__`); and
  the **verify gate** (`tests/test_metadata.py`: projections == seam, `[project]`↔
  sidecar no-drift incl. the Trove license classifier, and a case-insensitive
  fragment scan forbidding re-literalised composite ids). Killed the
  `notifications/_windows.py` AUMID literal (now `identity.windows_aumid()`).
  Validated by a 4-dimension adversarial review (21 findings, all confirmed ones
  fixed). Wheel build proven end-to-end.

Suite: **72 passed** (green across shuffle seeds + xdist), ruff clean. The
pre-baking work is **pushed**; Beat 1 is committed locally (**unpushed**).

## TODO — in rough priority order

### 1. Push Beat 1 to `origin`  ·  ready, quick
The metadata-core commits are local-only (the pre-baking 10 are already pushed).
Cheapest win; nothing's blocked on it.

### 2. Baking phase — Beat 2 (the renderer + first channels)  ·  ready (unblocked)
Beat 1 (the metadata core) is done. Next, from `docs/BAKING.md`:
- The `dough bake` **renderer** — walk `packaging/templates/**/*.j2`, substitute
  from `metadata.context()` (sidecar + projections + tag-version), write the tree.
  A CI gate re-renders and diffs against the committed files (generate-then-verify).
- First channels: **PyPI**, **AppImage**, **loose `.deb`** — lift + templatize from
  jellytoast (mapped: `release.yml` (366L), `packaging/deb/build_deb.sh`,
  `packaging/appimage/build_appimage.sh`, the `io.github.…desktop`/`.metainfo.xml`).
- The freedesktop pieces (`.desktop`/metainfo/icon) feed deb+AppImage; wire
  `setDesktopFileName` → `identity.desktop_id()` (= `app_id_base`) here and smoke
  the Wayland icon association (deferred from Beat 1 — needs a real desktop).
- Defer macOS (present-but-dormant; the `macos_team_id` placeholder is now in the
  sidecar), hosted apt/PPA, Flathub (policy-blocked — skip flathub.org).
- When templates land, extend the `test_metadata.py` composite-id gate to scan the
  `*.j2` + checked-in manifest fixtures (it's `dough/**/*.py`-scoped today).

### 3. Wire the shipped-but-dead subsystems into `run_app`  ·  ready (P1 leftover)
`notifications/` and `autostart/` ship but nothing calls them. `notifications/` is
now routed through `dough.identity`; **`autostart/` still holds bare-slug `"dough"`
literals** the review confirmed are fork-blind (`_linux.py` `.desktop` basename /
`Name=`/`Icon=`/`Exec -m dough` — and the source-copy path looks for `dough.desktop`
while an installer ships `io.github.…dough.desktop`, so the copy branch never
matches; `_windows.py` `_VALUE_NAME`/`-m dough`; `_flatpak.py` `commandline
["dough"]`). Route them through `dough.identity` (use `desktop_id()` for the
`.desktop`/icon names, `display_name()` for `Name=`) and wire them opt-in in `run_app`.

### 4. JellytoastWindow full inversion  ·  needs the real desktop + a server
The real jellytoast PR. Validated feasible; mechanical but **needs a KDE Wayland
desktop + a Jellyfin/Subsonic server to smoke-test the visual chrome**. Do it as a
guided session on the machine. Steps (also in the AI memory handoff):
- `PlayerBus(dough.bus.AppBus)`; delete its `_instance`/`get()`; dedup the 4 colliding
  signals; `AppBus.set_factory(PlayerBus)` in `main()` after `QApplication()`, before
  the first bus touch.
- `__main__` entry shim: `dough.configure(org='jellytoast', app='jellytoast',
  display_name='Jellytoast')` **before** importing `jellytoast.app` (import-time
  font-scale read). Keep `app='jellytoast'` to preserve the existing QSettings key
  (else saved geometry/theme silently reset).
- `JellytoastWindow(*mixins, dough.window.AppWindow)`; delete the duplicated chrome
  (`__init__` chrome block + the chrome-internals block); override `_make_top_bar`
  (JtTopBar), `set_content` (content_stack), `set_footer` (np_bar),
  `_paint_body_backdrop` (FauxFrost), `closeEvent` (minimize-to-tray).
- Smoke on KDE Wayland: blur, frameless drag/edge-resize, rounded-body squaring when
  maximized, music top bar, page switching, pinned np_bar, theme re-stamp.

### 5. P3 polish sweep  ·  low priority, cosmetic
- Route the remaining bare-slug identity literals through `dough.identity` (review-confirmed):
  - `dough/windows_shortcut.py` — `dough.exe` / `%LOCALAPPDATA%/dough/dough.ico` /
    `dough.lnk` (the AUMID + Description are already routed; these paths aren't).
  - `dough/power/_linux.py:56` — `Inhibit("dough", "Playing music")`: a music-domain
    leftover in a generic base. Use `identity.app()` + a neutral reason.
  - (`autostart/` is tracked above in §3.)
- Rename the `[JT.Lnk]` C# namespace in `windows_shortcut.py`.
- `JT_*` env vars + `jt*` objectName renames (currently self-consistent, harmless).
- Docstring sweep: `PlayerBus`→`AppBus`, music examples → neutral.
- Split `icons.py` into a chrome core vs a `dough.icons.media` extra.
- Fix `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md`'s false "identity comes from `applicationName()`" claim
  (it's now `dough.configure()` / `dough.identity`).
